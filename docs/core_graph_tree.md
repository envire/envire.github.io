The frame tree stores information about cartesian reference frames that are available in the environment. Every environment has a root frame, which can be retrieved from an environment object using the `getRootNode()` method.

Additional frames can be added to the frame tree using one of the two methods

```cpp
FrameNode *childFrame = new FrameNode(
    Eigen::Transform3d( Eigen::Translation3d( 0, 0, 1.0 ) ) );

env->addChild( env->getRootNode(), childFrame )
```

or alternatively

```cpp
env->getRootNode()->addChild( childFrame );
```

The second method obviously only works if the parent framenode is already attached to the environment.

## Transformation

The transformation given in the constructor of the FrameNode denotes the transformation from the given frame to the parent frame. For the above example, a point with (0, 0, 0) in `childFrame` would be (0, 0, 1.0) in the `parentFrame` (in this case the root Frame).

The transformation can be accessed using the `getTransform` and `setTransform` methods of the `FrameNode`.

In order to obtain the transformation between two arbitrary frames (both of which need to be connected to the same frame tree) the `relativeTransform` method can be used.

```
Transform3d C_a2b = env->relativeTransform( frameA, frameB );
```

Will return the transform C_a2b, which given a vector v in frame A would provide vâ€™ = C_a2b * v, the same vector in frame B.

## Uncertainty

The frame tree also supports uncertainty, but special methods have to be used for that. Using the `setTransformWithUncertainty` method of the frame allows you to provide a gaussian uncertainty of the transformation. The class for that is `TransformWithUncertainty`, which additionaly to the transformation stores the covariance of the position and rotation (as a scaled axis rotation) as a 6x6 matrix.

Chaining of transformations with uncertainty is also available, so you can see how the uncertainty propages through the frames. A simple example would be the following

```cpp
// create a point with uncertainty.
// we provide sigma values of 0.01 m, which have to be squared, 
// since the class is expecting a covariance
PointWithUncertainty p(
        Eigen::Vector3d( 0.0, 0, 0 ),
        Eigen::Vector3d( 0.01, 0.01, 0.01 )
            .array().square().matrix().asDiagonal() );

// create a 6x6 covariance matrix
Eigen::Matrix<double,6,1> lt1; 
lt1 <<
    0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0;

// create a transform with uncertainty from the given 
// diagonal of sigma values
TransformWithUncertainty t1(
        Eigen::Affine3d(
            Eigen::Translation3d(Eigen::Vector3d(r,0,0))),
        lt1.array().square().matrix().asDiagonal() );

// and a second one 
Eigen::Matrix<double,6,1> lt2; 
lt2 << 
    0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0;

TransformWithUncertainty t2(
        Eigen::Affine3d(
            Eigen::Affine3d::Identity()),
        lt2.array().square().matrix().asDiagonal );

// The point transformation is the same as without uncertainty, 
// but the uncertainty information is also propagated
PointWithUncertainty pp = t2 * t1 * p;
```

The same works when storing the `TransformationWithUncertainty` in the frame tree. Instead of `relativeTransform`, the `relativeTransformWithUncertainty` can be used.
